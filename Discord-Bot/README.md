  - Setup
    - To obtain a Discord API token, go to the Discord Developer website (found at the following link: https://discord.com/developers/applications) and select the application. Navigate to the 'Bot' tab, and click 'Copy' underneath were it says 'TOKEN'.
    - Next create a file called '.env' in the same directory as the bot.py code is stored
    - Within the file write '# .env', followed by newline, followed by 'DISCORD_TOKEN=', followed by the contents of the Token that has been copied to the clipboard. 
    - In order for the bot to work, the following must be installed:
      - Python3    (sudo apt install Python3)
      - pip3       (sudo apt install python-pip3)
      - discord.py (pip3 install discord.py)
      - dotenv     (pip3 install -U python-dotenv)
  - Usage
    - In order to use the bot once it has been activated on a server, type the command "mmm" in a message.
    - Upon the command "mmm", the bot will randomly select and post one from six qoutes taken from three stories relating to the names: Molly, Megan, and Milo.
  - Research
    - One method of prividing continual bot action to a server would be to host it from a rented virtual server. (Such as can be bought from the following website: https://www.ionos.com/servers/rent-a-server) This would provide a relatively non-expensive way to keep the bot going regardless of local machines' powered-up state, as services such as these are generally dedicated to running continually and disconnected to any local status.
    - A second, more company tailored, approach to solving this problem would be to buy or reserve a few servers to host the bot locally, and on ones own resources. This would be more expensive however, it would boast relitively greater security and privicey, as the bot would not be exposed to a third party.
