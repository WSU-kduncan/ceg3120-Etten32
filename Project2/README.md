Part 2:
1. Selected: Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM) - Kernel 5.10
	Default Username: root
2. I selected the vpc in the 'Network' choice, which automatically filled in the other needed blanks (such as Subnet).
3. It will not be auto-assigned. This way it cannot change without my knowledge and I will always be able to use the same ip to access my vpc.
4. I added a new volume by the setup screen's 'Add New Volume' button.
5. Selecting the 'Add Tags' page, I clicked 'Click to Add Tag' in the setup menu
6. Selecting the 'Configure Security Group' page, I chose 'Select an existing security group' and selected my pre-made group.
7. Selecting the 'Elastic IPs' on the sidebar, I clicked 'Allocate Elastic IP address'. Once the ip was allocated, I chose 'Associate Elastic IP address' from the dropdown menu under 'Actions' and selected my EC2.
